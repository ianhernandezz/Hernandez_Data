## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a report for Louise, with the goal to identify aspects of fundraising efforts that other plays based on the date of launch and projected goals had that allowed them to achieve these goals. There are other points of information provided that also gives a better idea as to what could have lead these other plays to be successful or not. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Initially I looked at all the data that was provided to get a grasp of what data points were being observed and what the potential outcome might present. After reading the expectations, I quickly identified the data information that would drive this research, which is the mostly money (pledge and goal) with other demographics that affect it.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

At a quick glance it can be deduced that based on date it is clear that the early summer months are the ones that allow for a better chance of success, but one must pay attention to the gradual decrease as the summer ends. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the information that is presented in the chart and the graph it can be determined that based on goals the outcomes can be very volatile. The higher the goal the more failures. There is a sweet spot between 30000 and 44999 for success rate. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One issue that I had ran into initially was creating the formulas to build the Pivot Tables as the information has to be precise, if not, it can throw off the values. After a few iterations of formulas, it was quite easy to make sure the data was correlating with what I was trying to identify. 
## Results

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

The two conclusions that I can draw from the information that is presented are as follows;

1.	As both the number and the line graph indicate, the summertime is a great factor in the success of a launch, specifically the months of May and June. The month of July is still above from the some of the other months, but it is already indicating a significant decrease of success. 

2.	One must be very selective when launching during the months of September to December. There is an increase in successes, but there is also a chance of failures. Conclusion being, make sure that it is a solid effort as there is a chance of a tough launch. 

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

  After taking a look at the results, it can be concluded that the more ambitious the goals the more failure to reach said goal. There needs to be a clear allocation of resources and create a realistic goal. Additionally, all the infromation provided in these charts and graphs need to be taken into account to properly make these decisions. Ultimatly, based on goals, it its easily determined that the lower the goal the higher the success rate. 


- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**

  Some limitations to the data set to this data are that these numbers strictly represent Successful, Failed, and Canceled. There is a data set of Live that could change the outcomes presented. Additionally, there is the factor of genre of these plays that could change popularity.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  
  Some other tables that could be created are; Data pertaining to genre and data of launch, genre and goal + pledge. Just these few graphs and tables could provide a huge insight into what factors drive the success of these efforts.
